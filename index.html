<h2><a href='http://rohan-french.github.io/post/barcanactually/'> The Barcan Formula, Necessary Existence and the Actuality Operator</a> </h2>
<h3>April 9, 2015</h3>
</div>

<p>One of the problems which those of us who believe that there are things which exist contingently (<em>Contingentists</em> to use Timothy Williamson&rsquo;s terminology) usually have with the Barcan Formula (=$\Diamond\exists x A \supset \exists x\Diamond A$) is that it somehow entails that everything which exists exists
necessarily. Usually this is demonstrated by appealing to the Converse Barcan Formula as well, which by itself already makes trouble for
the contingentist.</p>

<p>This might lead one to suspect that the Barcan
Formula is somehow &lsquo;safe&rsquo; so long as it doesn&rsquo;t bring the Converse Barcan Formula with it. Particular instances may have odd consequence,
perhaps, but one might wonder whether it brings with it undesirable purely logical consequences. So long as its truth still allows that
there are <em>some</em> things which are contingent existents then perhaps all is well. As it happens, though, this position is untenable, as  as surely the contingentist
must reject the principle of &lsquo;Necessary Actual Existence&rsquo;
$$
(N@E):\quad \Box\forall x @ \exists y (x = y)
$$
That is, the principle that necessarily everything is actual. Unfortunately, this principle is derivable from the Barcan Formula in the logic of actually.</p>

<h2><a href='http://rohan-french.github.io/post/abstract/'> Abstract for CLMPS</a> </h2>
<h3>April 8, 2015</h3>
</div>

<p>For those that (for some unknown reason) get their news about what&rdquo;s happening
from this little corner of the internet, the <a href="http://clmps.helsinki.fi/">15th Congress on Logic, Methodology
and the Philosophy of Science</a> is coming up in a few months, and today the
schedule and abstracts were posted on the website. As is common with many
things in this world we live in, lovely LaTeX was killed in the creation of
plaintext. To rectify this, for those that are interested, a loveingly MathML
rendered version of my abstract appears below the fold.</p>

<h2><a href='http://rohan-french.github.io/post/urn-logic/'> Urn Logic, Quantification and Modal Logic</a> </h2>
<h3>March 13, 2015</h3>
</div>

<p>One of the great pleasures of doing logic is finding problems in one area which can be solved using the techniques and
insights from another. What I want to briefly mention here is a neat example of this involving an interesting approach
to quantificational logic due to Veikko Rantala called <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00558760">&lsquo;Urn Logic&rsquo;</a>. The core idea behind urn logic&rsquo;s semantics for the
quantifiers is that the objects which the quantifiers range over can vary over the course of the evaluation of a formula,
depending on which objects are selected from the domain by earlier quantifiers. Veikko&rsquo;s original semantics for this is
in the style of Hintikka&rsquo;s game theoretic semantics, and I&rsquo;ve proposed a more standard version of the semantics in my
<a href="http://rohan-french.github.io/writing/urn-logic.pdf">&lsquo;A Sequent Calculus for Urn Logic&rsquo;</a>. What I&rsquo;m interested in here, though, is a &lsquo;classical&rsquo; semantics for Urn Logic proposed
by Max Cresswell, and how a question he asks about the expressivity of this semantics can be answered using a very familiar
construction from modal logic.</p>

<h2><a href='http://rohan-french.github.io/post/introductions/'> Introductions</a> </h2>
<h3>February 27, 2015</h3>
</div>

<p>Hello! Welcome to this, the website of Rohan French, Australian philosophical logician at large in Europe. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to put this site together for some time, and was recently inspired by the redesign of Greg Restall&rsquo;s wonderful <a href="http://consequently.org">consequently.org</a>, and how pleasant (for a tinkerer who briefly worked as a web developer) <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> was to use.</p>

<div class=image-left><img id=avatar src="http://rohan-french.github.io//images/rohan-avatar.jpg"></div><P>This
is the website of Dr. Rohan French, a philosophical logician at large in Europe. I did my PhD in
Australia
under the inimitable <a class="bar-link" href="http://profiles.arts.monash.edu.au/lloyd-humberstone/">Lloyd
Humberstone</a>, 
and am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in the <a class="bar-link"
href="http://www.rug.nl/filosofie/?lang=en">Department of Theoretical Philosophy</a> at
Rijksuniversiteit
Groningen working on the <a class="bar-link" href="https://sites.google.com/site/therootsofdeduction/">Roots of
Deduction</a> project. 
I turn coffee into sequent calculi and modal logics, among other things. You can find out more about me
