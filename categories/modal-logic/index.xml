&lt;p&gt;One of the great pleasures of doing logic is finding problems in one area which can be solved using the techniques and
insights from another. What I want to briefly mention here is a neat example of this involving an interesting approach
to quantificational logic due to Veikko Rantala called &lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00558760&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Urn Logic&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The core idea behind urn logic&amp;rsquo;s semantics for the
quantifiers is that the objects which the quantifiers range over can vary over the course of the evaluation of a formula,
depending on which objects are selected from the domain by earlier quantifiers. Veikko&amp;rsquo;s original semantics for this is
in the style of Hintikka&amp;rsquo;s game theoretic semantics, and I&amp;rsquo;ve proposed a more standard version of the semantics in my
&lt;a href=&#34;http://rohan-french.github.io/writing/urn-logic.pdf&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;A Sequent Calculus for Urn Logic&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;. What I&amp;rsquo;m interested in here, though, is a &amp;lsquo;classical&amp;rsquo; semantics for Urn Logic proposed
by Max Cresswell, and how a question he asks about the expressivity of this semantics can be answered using a very familiar
construction from modal logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cresswell-s-classical-exposition:e11132a276315be53ce9adcebdd68daf&#34;&gt;Cresswell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Classical Exposition&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cresswell&amp;rsquo;s semantics for Urn logic, which he articulates in his excellent paper
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00370339&#34;&gt;Urn Models: A Classical Exposition&lt;/a&gt;, are as follows. A model is a triple
$\langle A, D, V\rangle$, with $A$ being a set of individuals (approximately, our initial domain), and $V$ an assignment
of extensions to predicate letters (done in the usual manner). All the action in the semantics concerns $D$, which is
a function from sequences of objects from $A$ to subsets of $A$. We also change the recursive clause for the quantifiers
as follows
$$
\langle A, D, V\rangle\models \forall x \varphi[s] \iff \langle A, D, V\rangle\models \varphi[s&amp;rsquo;]
$$&lt;br /&gt;
where $s&amp;rsquo;$ is an $x$-variant of $s$ s.t. $s&amp;rsquo;(x)\in D(\langle s(x{1}), \ldots, s(x{n})\rangle)$ where
$x{1}, \ldots, x{n}$ are the free-variables in $\forall x\varphi$. For convenience (so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to make
some kind of choice concerning the order of the free-variables in formulas) we also need to impose the constraint that
$D(\langle a{1}, \ldots, a{n}\rangle) = D(\langle b{1}, \ldots, b{n}\rangle)$ whenever $b{1}, \ldots, b{n}$ is a
permutation of $a{1}, \ldots, a{n}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;re going to focus on here is a constraint on Urn Models which Cresswell singles out in the course of his completeness
proof, which we&amp;rsquo;ll call (Dist.) (in Cresswell&amp;rsquo;s paper it appears as &lt;strong&gt;4.3&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Dist.) If $b \in D(\langle a{1}, \ldots, a{n}\rangle)$ then $b$ is distinct from each $a{1}, \ldots, a{n}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning this condition Cresswell has the following to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The satisfaction of [(Dist.)] is interesting because it is not a condition one
would want to put on all urn models. This means that there would seem to
be no formula which entails that $a{i} \in D(\langle a{1}, \ldots, a{n}\rangle)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;
(Cresswell 1982, p.121)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cresswell is indeed right that (Dist.) is not a condition we want to place on all our urn models. As it happens, though, placing this
constraint on our models doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a difference to the validities of the logic as, given a model $\mathcal{M}$ which doesn&amp;rsquo;t
satisfy (Dist.) we can always construct a model $\mathcal{M^{d}}$ so that for every $\mathcal{M}$-assignment, there is a
$\mathcal{M^{d}}$-assignment s.t. $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{M^{d}}$ agree on which formulas are satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this we just need to use a construction which is reminiscient of the &amp;lsquo;unravelling&amp;rsquo; construction which is often used
to show that the class of all irreflexive frames is not modally definable&amp;mdash;which is not entirely surprising, considering the
extent to which (Dist.) looks like a combination of irreflexivity and antisymmetry on our &amp;lsquo;accessibility relation&amp;rsquo;. The construction
is relatively simple. First let us establish some notation. Given a sequence $s$ and a sequence $s&amp;rsquo;$ let $s\ast s&amp;rsquo;$ be the
concatenation of $s$ and $s&amp;rsquo;$, similarly given an object $a$ let $s\ast a$ be the result of concatenating $a$ to the end of $s$. Given a sequence of sequences $s = \langle s{1}, \ldots, s{n}\rangle$ say that $s{i}$ is the maximal element of $s$ iff $s{i}$ is the longest member of $s$. Finally, given a sequence $s$ let $s^{l}$ be the final element of $s$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-construction:e11132a276315be53ce9adcebdd68daf&#34;&gt;The Construction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that $\mathcal{M} = \langle A, D, V\rangle$ is an urn model. Let $\mathcal{M}^{d} = \langle A^{d}, D^{d}, V^{d}\rangle$ be defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$A^{d}$ is the set of all sequences $\langle a{1}, \ldots, a{n}$ of elements from $A$ where $a{n}\in D(\langle a{1}, \ldots, a{n-1}\rangle)$ (with $\langle a{1}\rangle\in A^{d}$ iff $a{1}\in D(\emptyset)$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$D^{d}(\emptyset) = D(\emptyset)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$s \in D^{d}(a{1}, \ldots, a{n})$ iff $s= a{i}\ast b$ for some $b\in A$, where $a{i}$ is the maximal element of $\langle a{1}, \ldots, a{n}\rangle$ and $b\in D(a{i})$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$V^{d}(F) = {\langle s{1}, \ldots, s{n}\rangle | \langle s{1}^{l}, \ldots s{n}^{l}\rangle \in V(F)}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post we&amp;rsquo;ll look (briefly) at how to show that $\mathcal{M}$ and
$\mathcal{M}^{d}$ validate the same formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
