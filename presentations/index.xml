      <title>Prover-Skeptic Games and Logical Pluralism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the logical pluralist, there may be more than one legitimate answer to the question of whether a given deductive argument is valid. The pluralist faces a challenge, though, to explain how this could be so. In this paper I show that by adopting the &amp;lsquo;built-in opponent&amp;rsquo; conception of deduction, a specific multi-agent dialogical account of our deductive practices, we can address the explanatory challenge: the different logics arise out of different norms effecting our argumentative and explanatory practices. In order to clarify our position we introduce Prover-Skeptic games, a novel kind of dialogue game introduced by Sørensen &amp;amp; Urzyczyn. Unlike traditional Lorenzen and Hintikka style dialogue games, theses are games of &amp;lsquo;proof-construction&amp;rsquo; as opposed to &amp;lsquo;formula-evaluation&amp;rsquo;, and thus they connect up better with the built-in opponent view of our deductive practices. We give a uniform adequacy result for a class of substructural implicational logics relative to Prover-Skeptic games, with the changes in the structural rules in play being reflected in a uniform manner in the dialogue game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>Dialogue Games for Bilateralism: Towards a Multi-Agent Account</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/presentations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;bilateralists&lt;/em&gt; we can think of logic as involving constraints on assertion and denial: a sequent $X\vdash Y$ being
valid whenever asserting all the sentences in $X$ and denying all the sentences in $Y$ invovles a clash. This account raises
two immediate questions: assertion and denial are social acts involving multiple agents, but barely a single agent is present in bilateralist accounts (them mostly involving `assertion in the void&amp;rsquo;); and secondly we need to know what is involved in a package
of assertions and denials involving a clash. I address both of these problems by looking at odd dialogue games intended to model
cooperative explorations of conversational positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title>Structural Reflexivity and the Semantic Paradoxes</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/presentations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That one can deal with the semantic paradoxes by restricting or rejecting structural rules is
now relatively well known. In particular, solutions which reject the structural rule of cut and
contraction are currently en vogue. What has not been seriously considered are the prospects
of dealing with the paradoxes by rejecting the ur-structural rule of reflexivity—for all
formulas $A$: $A \vdash A$. Here we will show that the non-reflexive approach to the semantic
paradoxes bears further investigation. In particular we will show that a fully non-reflexive
approach can capture much of what is desirable about classical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hypersequent Calculi for Contingent Existence</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/presentations/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is well known that the most straightforward way of adding rules for the quantifiers to
any adequate sequent calculus for the modal logic &lt;strong&gt;S5&lt;/strong&gt; allows for the derivation of the
Barcan formula&amp;mdash;$\diamondsuit\exists x\varphi \to \exists x \diamondsuit\varphi$. This
result is philosophically undesirable as, contra the Barcan Formula,  common-sense metaphysics would have it that things can possibly exist without actually existing. In this talk I give an
account of what is suspicious about such derivations by making use of a modal object
language with primitive scope indicators. Using this modal object language we see derivations of
the Barcan formula as requiring a certain kind of scope elision between &amp;ldquo;possibly, $a$ is $F$&amp;rdquo; (written in this
language as &amp;ldquo;$\diamondsuit\ a\ Fa$&amp;ldquo;) and &amp;ldquo;concerning $a$, possibly it is $F$&amp;rdquo; (written as &amp;ldquo;$a\
\diamondsuit Fa$&amp;ldquo;), where we are only able to infer &amp;ldquo;$\exists x \diamondsuit Fx$&amp;rdquo; from  the second
of these
formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
