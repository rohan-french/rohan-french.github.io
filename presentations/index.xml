      <title>A Dialogical Account of Logical Pluralism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to logical pluralists there may be more than one legitimate answer to the question of whether a given deductive argument is valid.
Those who wish to defend a pluralist position face a kind of explanatory challenge: how can there be multiple correct notions of logical
consequence. In the present talk I will argue that adopting a multi-agent dialogical account of logical consequence allows quite directly
for an interesting form of logical pluralism. In order to clarify the position I introduce &lt;em&gt;Prover-Skeptic Games&lt;/em&gt;, a novel kind of
dialogue game (initially introduced by Sørensen &amp;amp; Urzyczyn in the context of the lambda-calculus) which more closely resembles &amp;lsquo;proof-construction&amp;rsquo; rather than &amp;lsquo;formula-evaluation&amp;rsquo;. We then use these dialogue games to show how interest-relative
features of explanation result in an interest-relative form of logical pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Truthmakers, Partial Content, and Logical Subtraction</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/melbourne-yablo-workshop/</link>

      <guid>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/melbourne-yablo-workshop/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I show how various desirable formal features of partial content and logical
subtraction are sensitive to whether we understand them in terms of &lt;em&gt;recursive&lt;/em&gt; truthmakers (as favoured
by Fine and van Frassen) or &lt;em&gt;reductive&lt;/em&gt; truthmakers (which Yablo prefers). In particular if we think of
partial content in terms of &lt;em&gt;reductive&lt;/em&gt; truthmakers (which when dealing with propositional languages correspond
to the minimal partial valuations generated by the prime implicants of a formula) then both partial content and
logical subtraction fail to be closed under uniform substitution. When characterised in terms of recursive truthmakers
both of these notions are closed under uniform substitution. Prima facie, this suggests that if we want to think of either
of these notions as holding in virtue of logical form, then we had best understand them in terms of recursive truthmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Simple Sequent Calculus for Angell&#39;s Logic of Analytic Containment</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/melbourne-aal-angell/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 22:50:24 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/melbourne-aal-angell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a number of publications dating from 1977, R.B. Angell put forward a novel relevant logic
whose arrow formulas are most naturally read as recording that the content of the consequent
is analytically contained in the content of the antecedent. More recently, Kit Fine has suggested
that the first-degree fragment of this logic is a natural formulation of the notion of partial
content, presenting an intuitive semantics for it in terms of truth-maker semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present paper I put forward a simple sequent calculus for Angell&amp;rsquo;s logic, and show why
this is the correct logic of partial content for a range of logics including classical logic as
well as illustrating some vistas that this approach opens up for treating the notion of logical
subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prover-Skeptic Games and Logical Pluralism</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/amsterdam-proverskeptic/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the logical pluralist, there may be more than one legitimate answer to the question of whether a given deductive argument is valid. The pluralist faces a challenge, though, to explain how this could be so. In this paper I show that by adopting the &amp;lsquo;built-in opponent&amp;rsquo; conception of deduction, a specific multi-agent dialogical account of our deductive practices, we can address the explanatory challenge: the different logics arise out of different norms effecting our argumentative and explanatory practices. In order to clarify our position we introduce Prover-Skeptic games, a novel kind of dialogue game introduced by Sørensen &amp;amp; Urzyczyn. Unlike traditional Lorenzen and Hintikka style dialogue games, theses are games of &amp;lsquo;proof-construction&amp;rsquo; as opposed to &amp;lsquo;formula-evaluation&amp;rsquo;, and thus they connect up better with the built-in opponent view of our deductive practices. We give a uniform adequacy result for a class of substructural implicational logics relative to Prover-Skeptic games, with the changes in the structural rules in play being reflected in a uniform manner in the dialogue game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dialogue Games for Bilateralism: Towards a Multi-Agent Account</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/standrews-bilateralismgames/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Nov 2015 22:50:24 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;bilateralists&lt;/em&gt; we can think of logic as involving constraints on assertion and denial: a sequent $X\vdash Y$ being
valid whenever asserting all the sentences in $X$ and denying all the sentences in $Y$ invovles a clash. This account raises
two immediate questions: assertion and denial are social acts involving multiple agents, but barely a single agent is present in bilateralist accounts (them mostly involving `assertion in the void&amp;rsquo;); and secondly we need to know what is involved in a package
of assertions and denials involving a clash. I address both of these problems by looking at odd dialogue games intended to model
cooperative explorations of conversational positions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structural Reflexivity and the Semantic Paradoxes</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/gap9-2015/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That one can deal with the semantic paradoxes by restricting or rejecting structural rules is
now relatively well known. In particular, solutions which reject the structural rule of cut and
contraction are currently en vogue. What has not been seriously considered are the prospects
of dealing with the paradoxes by rejecting the ur-structural rule of reflexivity—for all
formulas $A$: $A \vdash A$. Here we will show that the non-reflexive approach to the semantic
paradoxes bears further investigation. In particular we will show that a fully non-reflexive
approach can capture much of what is desirable about classical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

      <title> Hypersequent Calculi for Contingent Existence</title>
      <link>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/clmps-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 11:00:24 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rohan-french.github.io/presentations/clmps-2015/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is well known that the most straightforward way of adding rules for the quantifiers to
any adequate sequent calculus for the modal logic &lt;strong&gt;S5&lt;/strong&gt; allows for the derivation of the
Barcan formula&amp;mdash;$\diamondsuit\exists x\varphi \to \exists x \diamondsuit\varphi$. This
result is philosophically undesirable as, contra the Barcan Formula,  common-sense metaphysics would have it that things can possibly exist without actually existing. In this talk I give an
account of what is suspicious about such derivations by making use of a modal object
language with primitive scope indicators. Using this modal object language we see derivations of
the Barcan formula as requiring a certain kind of scope elision between &amp;ldquo;possibly, $a$ is $F$&amp;rdquo; (written in this
language as &amp;ldquo;$\diamondsuit\ a\ Fa$&amp;ldquo;) and &amp;ldquo;concerning $a$, possibly it is $F$&amp;rdquo; (written as &amp;ldquo;$a\
\diamondsuit Fa$&amp;ldquo;), where we are only able to infer &amp;ldquo;$\exists x \diamondsuit Fx$&amp;rdquo; from  the second
of these
formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
